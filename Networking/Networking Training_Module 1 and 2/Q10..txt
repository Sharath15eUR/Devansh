10. Explain how a DHCP server assigns IP addresses to devices in your network.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices in a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP assignment and ensures efficient IP address management.

How DHCP Works: The Four-Step Process

1.DHCP Discovery:
	When a device (client) connects to the network, it broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to find a DHCP server.
	
DHCP Offer:
	The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER, which contains an available IP address,subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server details.

DHCP Request:
	The client replies with a DHCPREQUEST message to confirm the acceptance of the 	offered IP address.

DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK):

	The DHCP server sends a DHCPACK (acknowledgment), confirming the lease, and the client can now use the assigned IP address.
